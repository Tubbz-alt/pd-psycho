#X text 71 291 The dB unit is logarithmic \, therefore so is loudness
in phons. The sone scale was then created to provide a linear scale
of loudness. In this way \, 2 sones is twice as loud as 1 sones \,
4 sones is twice as loud as 2 sones and so on.;
#X text 70 344 The loudness of N = 1 sone is equivalent to 40 phons
\, which is the loudness of a 1KHz sine wave at 40 dB.;
